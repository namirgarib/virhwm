# Virtual Hardware Microprogram
üö® **The rewrite of this project is not finished. If you wish to use it with Qt and OpenCV simulation, please use the archived code from the old project in the `archived` folder.** üö®
This project is a rewrite of a personal project I created a few months ago. The original version had some sloppy code, and I am now rewriting it to make the code more readable, modular, and maintainable.

## Overview

The project simulates a microprogram that calculates the sum of products for values stored in the A and B registers. Specifically, it multiplies the corresponding values from the A and B registers and sums the results consecutively (i.e., product of the first values from A and B, plus product of the second values from A and B, etc.). The final result is stored in memory.

## Features
- **Microprogram control**: Executes the sum of products for register values.
- **Customizable**: You can modify the microinstructions to experiment with other operations.
- **Memory Management**: A and B registers are set and their values are updated dynamically into memory.
- **Dynamic Linking**: The project requires OpenCV and Qt to be dynamically linked.

## Prerequisites
- **OpenCV**: Make sure you have OpenCV installed and dynamically linked.
- **Qt**: Ensure that Qt is installed and linked appropriately.

You'll need to modify the compilation settings to match your versions of OpenCV and Qt.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
- **include/**: Contains the header files for the project.
- **archived/**: Contains files from the old version of the project. These files are used as references during the rewrite. Feel free to experiment with these if you'd like.

## Explanation of `MIP` Struct Signals

The `MIP` struct contains a set of signals that control the flow of data and the execution of the microprogram. Each signal has a specific role in managing memory, the ALU, registers, and branching behavior.

#### A-bus and ALU Control Signals
- **Al**: Latch control for `a_reg`. When set, the result from the ALU (`C`) is latched into `a_reg`.
- **Ao**: Selects `a_reg` as the input for the A-side of the ALU.
- **A1o**: Selects constant `1` as the input for the A-side of the ALU.
- **A0o**: Selects constant `0` as the input for the A-side of the ALU.
- **MA1i**: Selects the output of the ALU (C) or the emit field as the input for `ma1_reg`.
- **MA1l**: Latch control for `ma1_reg`. When set, stores the value from the selected input.
- **A1I**: Increments `ma1_reg` by 1 when set (used for loop-like behavior).
- **MA1o**: Selects `ma1_reg` as the input for the A-side of the ALU.

#### B-bus and ALU Control Signals
- **Byo**: Selects the output of the ALU (C) as the input for the A-side of the ALU.
- **MD1i**: Determines whether to use the emit field or ALU output (C) as the input for the memory data register `md1_reg`.
- **MD1l**: Latch control for `md1_reg`, determining when data from memory or another source is stored in `md1_reg`.
- **BMD1o**: Selects `md1_reg` as the input for the B-side of the ALU.
- **MD2i**: Determines whether the emit field, ALU output, or another source will be used for `md2_reg`.
- **MD2l**: Latch control for `md2_reg`. Stores a value into `md2_reg` when set.
- **MA2l**: Latch control for `ma2_reg`. Stores the selected input value when set.
- **A2I**: Increments `ma2_reg` by 1 when set.
- **BMPYo**: Selects the output of the multiplication unit (`D`) as the input for the B-side of the ALU.

#### Pipeline and Loop Control
- **Lpl**: Latch control for the loop register (`loop_reg`). Stores the `emit` field value into the loop register.
- **Lpc**: Decrements the `loop_reg` by 1, used for managing loops or repeated instructions.

#### Memory Control
- **r_w**: Read/write flag. `1` for memory read, `0` for memory write.
- **memo**: Selects the memory data output, helping to manage data bus conflicts.
- **MMD1o**: Memory Data Output 1. When cleared (`0`), selects `md1_reg` for writing to memory.
- **MMD2o**: Memory Data Output 2. When cleared (`0`), selects `md2_reg` for writing to memory.

#### ALU and Arithmetic Control
- **alu**: ALU operation control, which determines the operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) to be performed by the ALU.
- **Deo**: Data emission output control, used to emit data from the ALU or other sources into specific registers.

#### Condition Flags and Control
- **Beo**: Emit control for the B-side of the ALU, which can use the emit field as the input for `B`.
- **ovf**: Overflow flag. Set when the result of an arithmetic operation in the ALU has overflowed.
- **zf**: Zero flag. Set when the result of an ALU operation is zero.
- **mf**: Minus flag. Set when the result of an ALU operation is negative.

#### Branch Control and Execution
- **ncld**: No-Condition Load, used for unconditional jumps or branches.
- **stp**: Stop flag, halts the execution of the microprogram when set.
- **emit**: Emit field, a value that can be emitted to registers, memory, or ALU inputs. Acts as an immediate data value for various control operations.

### Microprogram Instruction Explanation

The following microprogram instructions are defined in the `MIP mip[]` array, which controls the operations of the processor. Each line in the program represents a step in the microprogram's execution. Below is a detailed breakdown of the signals and the actions taken during each step, as well as the purpose of each step in the overall program.

#### Instruction Breakdown:

1. **PC:1 ‚Üí `MA1_reg` ‚Üê emit(-1)**
    - The `MA1_reg` is loaded with the emitted value `-1`. This sets up the memory address for the upcoming memory operations.
    - **Purpose**: Initialize the memory address register (`MA1_reg`) with `-1` to prepare for subsequent memory operations.

2. **PC:2 ‚Üí `MA2_reg` ‚Üê emit(7)**
    - The `MA2_reg` is loaded with the emitted value `7`. This is another address register setup.
    - **Purpose**: Set the second memory address register (`MA2_reg`) to the value `7`.

3. **PC:3 ‚Üí `loop_reg` ‚Üê emit(8)**
    - The `loop_reg` is loaded with the value `8`.
    - **Purpose**: Initialize the loop register for an iteration that will repeat for `8` cycles.

4. **PC:4 ‚Üí ALU ‚Üê `A_reg + emit(0)`**
    - The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) computes the sum of the `A_reg` and an emitted value of `0`.
    - **Purpose**: Perform a simple addition using the ALU. This can act as a placeholder or setup for further ALU operations.

5. **PC:5 ‚Üí `MD1_reg` ‚Üê ALU**
    - The result from the ALU is stored in `MD1_reg` (Memory Data Register 1).
    - **Purpose**: Store the ALU result into the first memory data register (`MD1_reg`).

6. **PC:6 ‚Üí `MA1_reg` ‚Üê emit(63)**
    - The `MA1_reg` is updated with the emitted value `63`.
    - **Purpose**: Set the memory address register (`MA1_reg`) to point to memory address `63`.

7. **PC:7 ‚Üí `mem[MA1_reg]` ‚Üê `MD1_reg`**
    - The contents of `MD1_reg` are stored in memory at the address contained in `MA1_reg`.
    - **Purpose**: Write the data in `MD1_reg` to the memory address `63`.

#### Summary of Operations:

- **MA1_reg**: Holds the memory address for the first operand or result.
